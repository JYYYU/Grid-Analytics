## PJM Data Usage

PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States, provides critical market and operational data for the energy industry. However, as per their usage guidelines, data obtained from **DataMiner2** (PJM's data platform) is subject to the following restriction:

- **Internal Use Only**: The data and information from PJM are strictly for internal use, and redistribution of this data or any derived data is prohibited without a PJM membership.

Because of these restrictions, **I am unable to publicly share the PJM data** used in this project. This includes any raw data or processed data that directly derives from PJM datasets. As such, you will not find the actual PJM data files within this repository.

## Data Availability

While the data from PJM is not available for public sharing, I have made available the data processing scripts that can grab the necessary data.

## Why Is The Data Not Shared?

As stated in the PJM rules, sharing this data publicly would violate their terms of service. Specifically:

> "Note that information and data contained in Data Miner is for internal use only and redistribution of information and/or data contained in or derived from Data Miner is strictly prohibited without a PJM membership."

To comply with these terms, I have refrained from uploading any PJM-specific data to this repository.
