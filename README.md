# Grid Analytics

**PJM Energy Market Analysis and Forecasting**

This project analyzes historical grid performance data in the PJM energy market to understand price variability, outage impacts, and grid stress. By leveraging advanced data science techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to uncover key insights and predict critical grid conditions.


**Project Highlights:**
1. Historical Analysis:
- Understand LMP (Locational Marginal Price) trends and variability across nodes and regions.
- Examine planned vs. forced outages and their influence on grid performance.

2. Risk Identification:
- Identify regions prone to congestion using metrics like LMP volatility, outage intensity, and capacity margin.
- Highlight stress indicators to detect early signs of emergency conditions.

3. Regional Comparisons:
- Compare grid performance across zones, pinpointing disparities and stability.

4. Machine Learning Predictions:
- Develop predictive models for emergency-triggered conditions, congestion risks, and LMP price variability.
Use state-of-the-art algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting for enhanced accuracy.

5. Actionable Dashboard:
- Deliver an interactive visualization platform to support maintenance planning, infrastructure upgrades, and grid reliability improvements.

**Why This Matters:**
As the PJM grid faces rising demand and increasing complexity, this project equips energy stakeholders with the tools to predict, analyze, and mitigate risks. From identifying high-risk nodes to optimizing grid reliability, the insights from this analysis can drive better decision-making and improve market outcomes.
